# Vulnerable-Web-App
The main goal of VWA is to provide a list of vulnerable web applications available to security professionals for hacking and offensive activities, so that they can attack realistic web environmentsâ€¦ without going to jail :)

# What is exactly this is ?
Vulnerable-Web-Application categorically includes Command Execution, File Inclusion, File Upload, Authentication Bypass, SQL and XSS. For database-requiring categories, it creates a database under localhost with one button during setup. In case of corrupted or changed databases, you can create a database again.
(You have to find the database as i have made that hidden)
